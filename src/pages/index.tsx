            I started my coding journey back in 2018 when I was studying for becoming a Civil Engineer. It was just a subject but the one I enjoyed the most, and ended up switching to pursue a Systems Engineering degree in 2020.

            My first programming languages were C and Python but I quickly moved to Web Development. Overall, what I really wanted to do is to build stuff and see them live out there in the world. I couldn&apos;t build a bridge like I thought I would end up doing in my first years of college, but I certainly could achieve a lot with coding too.

            I started with the basics then got into <b>React</b>, and eventually <b>Next</b>.

            My first job was as a freelance teacher and occasionally some really small web development projects.
            That led me to my first office job in 2021. I took the leap in 2022 and joined a startup team from Australia, where I made the most progress as a person and developer.

            But anyways, <i>not everything is about work</i>.

            I&apos;m a huge music enthusiast. I taught myself piano during the pandemic and later took music theory classes. Outside of it, I find joy reading, solving puzzles, and every once in a while, snowboarding. Yeah, I&apos;m a winter person.
